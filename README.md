This challenge works with a custom-designed markup language HRML. In HRML, each element consists of a starting and ending tag, and there are attributes associated with each tag. Only starting tags can have attributes. We can call an attribute by referencing the tag, followed by a tilde, '~' and the name of the attribute. The tags may also be nested.

The opening tags follow the format:

<tag-name attribute1-name = "value1" attribute2-name = "value2" ...>

The closing tags follow the format:

</tag-name>

The attributes are referenced as:

tag1~value  
tag1.tag2~name

Given the source code in HRML format consisting of N lines, answer Q queries. For each query, print the value of the attribute specified. Print "Not Found!" if the attribute does not exist.
